Pathfinder can be deployed on various cloud platforms to ensure scalability and availability. Below are brief instructions for deploying Pathfinder on popular cloud platforms.

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Setup

1. **Create a Virtual Machine**: Create a VM instance on GCP with the recommended hardware specifications for running Pathfinder.
    
2. **Install Docker**: SSH into your VM and install Docker as per the [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
    
3. **Run Pathfinder**: Use the earlier Docker commands to run Pathfinder on your GCP instance.
    

### Amazon Web Services (AWS) Setup

1. **Launch an EC2 Instance**: Create an EC2 instance using the recommended hardware specifications.
    
2. **Install Docker**: Connect to your EC2 instance and install Docker.
    
3. **Run Pathfinder**: Run Pathfinder using Docker or Docker Compose, as explained in the earlier sections.
    

These cloud deployment setups help ensure that Pathfinder is accessible and can scale based on the network's needs.
