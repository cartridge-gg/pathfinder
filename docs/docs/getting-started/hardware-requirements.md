# Hardware Requirements

Pathfinder's hardware requirements depend greatly on your use case. The recommended configuration for fast syncing and JSON-RPC queries (with limited concurrency) is:

* **CPU**: 4 cores
* **RAM**: 8 GB
* **Storage**: 250 GB SSD
    

If you plan to operate in archive mode for historical queries or run multiple concurrent JSON-RPC requests, consider increasing CPU and memory.
